    This is the 6th time the festival is being held.

    In 2021, the festival attracted 500.000 visitors, which makes it the most visited festival in Denmark.

    The festival features more than 55 installations, pop-up events, and theme-events.

    The installations are concentrated in the city enter, but the outsides of the city are also involved, in places such as Bavnehøj, Sundby, Refshaleøen and Ørestad.

    Walking, cycling and running routes have been developed that lead you straight to the installations. These vary in length, from 2,5 km-9 km.

    Our app, which was downloaded 50.000 times last year, features light-themed treasure hunts with various prizes.
